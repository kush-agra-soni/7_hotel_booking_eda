Filling with the most frequent country value is a simple yet effective way to handle these missing entries without introducing significant bias.\n","   \n","2. **`agent`**:\n","   - The `agent` column had a larger number of missing values (16,337 out of 119,384). Imputing with `0` (no agent) assumes that the absence of an agent is the default condition. This could be a valid assumption, but further investigation into how often agents are involved in bookings could refine this approach.\n","\n","3. **Data Quality**:\n","   - The imputations prevent the loss of data, ensuring that rows are preserved for further analysis. However, the imputation method chosen (mode for `country` and 0 for `agent`) might affect the distribution of values in these columns, so care should be taken when analyzing them.\n","\n","Overall, the manipulations ensure that the dataset remains usable while minimizing data loss.
